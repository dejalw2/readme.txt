# Description

Since my youth, I've harbored a keen interest in savings and entrepreneurship. As I've matured, my fascination has extended to real estate, financial instruments like Roth IRA, High Yield Savings, and overall financial literacy. With this project, I aim to develop a personal finance tracker using Python. This tool will enable users to input their expenses, categorize them, set budgets, and even generate reports to analyze spending habits, akin to features found in banking apps.

# Usage

To utilize this code, execute the following command:

```bash
python3.11 wooten_deja_finalproject.py

# Code Design

I split the main ideas into 3 classes: ExpenseInput to handle all expenses, BudgetSetting to store the budget information, and ReportGeneration for conclusions.



Three Functions: expense input, budget setting, and report generation. 

Expense Input Function: input expenses (date, amount, store, category)

Budget Setting Function: set monthly budgets for each category (potential categories: groceries, entertainment, travel, etc.) 

Report Generation Function: reports will be generated summing up expenses, total spending etc
